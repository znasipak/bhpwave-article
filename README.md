We present `bhpwave`: a new Python-based, open-source tool for generating the gravitational waveforms of stellar-mass compact objects undergoing quasi-circular inspirals into rotating massive black holes. These binaries, known as extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), are exciting millihertz gravitational wave sources for future space-based detectors. Relativistic models of EMRI gravitational wave signals are necessary to unlock the full scientific potential of these astrophysical sources, yet few open-source EMRI waveform models exist. To fill this void we built `bhpwave`, which uses the adiabatic approximation from black hole perturbation theory to rapidly construct gravitational waveforms based on the leading-order inspiral dynamics of the binary. Crucially `bhpwave` is the first open-source adiabatic model to produce waveforms for binaries with *rotating* massive black holes, opening a new dimension of parameter space for astrophysical investigation.
